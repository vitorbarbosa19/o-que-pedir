# O Que Pedir?

In this project, you have access to a database of the best restaurant dishes all over the world, curated by a community of brazilian users (at this point).

Its frontend was built using React.js. Its backend uses Graphcool to access a database coupled with a production-ready GraphQL server. The frontend queries the server through the Apollo client for React.js.

# User Stories
So far, we have the following user stories implemented. A user can:
 * See a list of top-rated dishes from all over the world.
 * Filter this list by Restaurant Name, City or Type of Cuisine.
 * Login using social accounts (Facebook, Google and Twitter).
 * Add a new dish to the database. It will be visible to all users (logged in or not).
